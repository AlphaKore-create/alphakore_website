Drop a high-resolution seamless galaxy texture named `galaxy.png` into this folder.

Requirements:
- Filename: `galaxy.png`
- Size: ideally 2K–4K width for large displays (e.g. 2048×2048 or 4096×2048)
- Tone: dark-blue / indigo with subtle nebula dust and stars; avoid heavy warm/orange tones that clash with the site horizon.
- Seamless/edge-blend friendly preferred, but not strictly required because CSS uses `background-size: cover`.

Place the file here:

/public/textures/galaxy.png

Once you've added the image, the overlay will automatically use it. If you prefer a different filename, update `src/index.css` `background` URL accordingly.
